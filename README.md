The research object of the reference paper is the size and stability of excess return rate of momentum effect and reversal effect under (p, q) (measured by coefficient of variation). The most important parameters of momentum reversal strategy are p in the formation period and Q in the reversal period. Based on the momentum reversal test of shanghai-Shenzhen 300 stocks, this research paper draws a conclusion: For momentum portfolio, the observation period of 14-15 weeks and holding period of 9-15 perform better; for reverse portfolio, the observation period of 26-30 and holding period of 26-30 perform best. Based on this conclusion, I choose momentum combination (14,14) and reversal combination (30,30) for reproduction.
